# Training-a-NN-on-Car_Insurance-dataset
A neural network was trained on the car insurance dataset which I played with before by applying logistic regression and XGBoost. I tried to tune the hyperparameters by keras tuner. The accuracy was same as LR and XGBoost. However a tensorboard was created to analyze the errors. In the next step Some data manipulation should be done to see if the accuracy can be improved. 
The file Data.csv is a preprocessed version of car insurance dataset. A comprehensive description of the dataset and details of clearing process can be found at https://github.com/Mohsensdg/Classification-by-Logistic-Regression-and-XGBoost.
